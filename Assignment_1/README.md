# 1. To use the calculator, first run the Python file to start the program. You will then be prompted to enter the first and second numbers. If an invalid value is entered, the program will ask again until a valid number is provided.

# 2. Next, you must select an operation: 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division. If division by zero is attempted, the program will display an error message instead of a result.

# 3. After performing the calculation, the program will display the result and ask whether you would like to perform another calculation. Enter “yes” to continue or “no” to exit the program. If any other input is given, the program will request a valid response.
